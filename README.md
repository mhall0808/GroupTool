# GroupTool
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<hr>
The purpose of the Grouping Tool is to create discussion boards with multiple topics and attach them to grade items in Brightspace, specifically for <strong>I-Learn 3.0</strong> for <strong>Brigham Young University - Idaho</strong>, to assist in creating online courses that have group discussion forums.  However, it can be used with any Brightspace course.

<h2>Scope</h2>
<hr>
The grouping tool will do the following:
 * Create Discussion Boards
 * Create multiple topics within the Discussion Boards
 * Create Grade Items
 * Attach grades to the Discussion Boards

<hr>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<hr>
Currently, Brightspace does not support importing Groups, unless it is copying from another course.  Therefore, this tool is unable to generate groups, and this will have to be done manually.
